# Portfolio

Hi there! Welcome to this personal project of mine where I will explore various tools related (or not) to technical writing and technology in general. 

This whole project and its content will serve as my portfolio.

## What you will find

- The website
- My other projects
- A blog (maybe?)
- Tools I create

## In more detail

I used mkdocs to create a docs like website.

  - Created the repo and setup.
  - Played around with CSS, HTML and JS files to change the overall appearance of the site.
  - Designed the content as to closely ressemble my optimal documentation site.
